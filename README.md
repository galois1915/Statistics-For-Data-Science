## Descriptive Statistics

## Statistical Experiments
Statistical experiments involve systematically collecting and analyzing data to test hypotheses or answer research questions. 
1. **A/B Testing:** Compares two versions of a variable to determine which performs better.
2. **Resampling:** Technique that involves repeatedly drawing samples to obtain additional information about a population.
3. Power and Sample Size: Ensures experiments have sufficient sensitivity to detect meaningful effects.
4. Multi-Arm Bandit Algorithm: Optimization method for decision-making in scenarios with multiple treatment options.

## Statistical Inference
Statistical inference involves making generalizations about populations based on sample data.
1. **Hypothesis Tests:** Evaluates evidence against a null hypothesis to make inferences about populations.
2. **Statistical Significance and p-values:** Determines the probability of observed results by chance.
3. t-Tests: Compares means between two groups.
4. Multiple Testing: Adjusts for increased risk of false positives when conducting multiple hypothesis tests.
5. Degrees of Freedom: Influences variability in statistical tests.
6. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Compares means among three or more groups.
7. Chi-Square Test: Assesses independence between categorical variables.
